# PCA LDA FDA
 This repository contains python implementation of PCA, LDA and FDA from scratch on MNIST dataset. Noise removal effect of PCA is also depicted visually.

### Dataset used:
MNIST

Steps taken:
1. Finding the global mean and covariance of data.
2. Implementation of PCA, FDA and LDA from scratch.
3. Visualize and analyze the eigenvectors obtained using PCA with 95% eigen energy.
4. Finding accuracies at different values of eigen energies.
5. Displaying eigenvectors by converting them into image form
6. Performing FDA then LDA.
7. Performing PCA then FDA.

### Instructions
Just enter path to the idx train test files in the code.
